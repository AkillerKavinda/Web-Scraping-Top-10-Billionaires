# Web-Scraping-Top-10-Billionaires

A beginner-friendly project **scraping the top 10 billionaires of 2025 from Wikipedia** and performing simple analysis to **practice web scraping, data handling, and visualization** in Python.

## About the Project

This project demonstrates the **end-to-end workflow** of web scraping and basic data analysis:

- **Scraping:** Extracting structured data from Wikipedia tables using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.  
- **Cleaning & Handling:** Organizing and processing data using `pandas`.  
- **Visualization:** Exploring the dataset through bar plots with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.  
- **Output:** Saving a clean dataset to CSV and generating visual insights.  

Even with a small dataset (top 10 billionaires), this project highlights the **core skills required for real-world data projects**.
